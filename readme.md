<h4>Application Description:</h4>
<p>This web app is designed and implemented for users who want to search local 
news and information of NYC. Besides, users can log in and sign up. When 
user is at his/her own account, he/she can modify settings, delete account or log out!</p>
<h4>App Start Instruction:</h4>
<p>Make sure to run build.gradle first to set up springboot environment, and type
"npm install" inside nyc-search-ui to install all dependencies.</p>
<p>Once you have docker on your computer and would be better to have
docker-compose CLI installed, you can just spin up the whole system
by typing "docker-compose up" inside the project folder. When docker-compose inlitialization
gets done, you can type "http://localhost:3000" to play with this app.</p>
<h4>App Test Instruction:</h4>
<p>Run full tests is simple, just type "./gradlew test" inside project folder 
to fire up the whole testing procedure.</p>
<p>Bonus point: Run react component tests by typing "npm test" inside nyc-search-ui folder.</p>
